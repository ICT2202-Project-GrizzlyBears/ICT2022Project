<<User Manual Guide>>

Programming language used: 
Python 3.0 and above

Required Python's inbuilt modules:
1) Tkinter (Graphical user interface package)
>> make sure to include filedialog which is a set of functions that can be used to work with files
2) cv2 (Image processing)
3) numpy (Performs wide variety of mathematical operations on arrays)
4) Pillow Library (PIL) (Save many different formats of images)
5) math (Access to mathematical functions)

If encounter issue importing module cv2, user can do so by entering the following commands in the terminaal:
>> conda update anaconda-navigator  
>> conda update navigator-updater

Brief description on how the codes/functions work:
#Main screen basic configurations
Tk(): Main window created
title(): Name of the main window displayed, in this case will be our application name 'StegGB'
geometry(): Size of the main window
configure(background='lavender'): Sets background color of the main window
Button(): Creates a button
place(): Sets the position of the widget on the window

#Main functions
errorMsg(): Error messagebox displayed after no image is selected
encodeimage(): Encode secret message in the image selected
saveFilename(): Save file after entering the secret message and new file name
confirmMsg(): Validates empty inputs, display messagebox whether it is successful or not
decodeimage(): Decodes the secret message in the image
loadImg(): Displays the image selected from file explorer on GUI
chooseFile(): Select images from file explorer (filtered with only .jpg, .png and .bmp extensions)

After ensuring the above functions have no issues, proceed to run the program.

Steps to encode image:
1) Click on the button 'Choose Image' to select the image from the file explorer
2) The image selected will be displayed below
3) Next, click 'Encode' button to encode message into the image selected
	>> If user clicked 'Encode' or 'Decode' button before selecting the image, a popup messagebox will be displayed to remind user to select image.
4) Another window will appear for you to enter the message to encode
5) Enter the message to encode
6) Enter filename with extension (.jpg/.png/.bmp)
7) Click 'Save File' button to complete the encoding
	>> If user clicked 'Save File' button before entering the message or filename, a popup messagebox will be displayed to remind user to fill up the required fields.
8) The file saved will goes to C drive > Users > [user] > PycharmProjects > [project_file]

Steps to decode image:
1) Click on the button 'Choose Image' to select the image from the file path in which the encoded image is saved.
2) The image selected will be displayed below
3) Next, click 'Decode' button to encode message into the image selected
	>> If user clicked 'Encode' or 'Decode' button before selecting the image, a popup messagebox will be displayed to remind user to select image.
4) Another window will appear with the decoded message.
